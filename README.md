# Gracious-Giving

I was tasked to create a website with an integrated payment gateway. The website will have a donate button which will land the user on the payment page where the user can input the amount to be paid and the mode of payment.



Once the payment is made, an invoice should be generated, and an email should be sent to the user for payment received. 



I used #html5 for the markup language, used #css and #bootstrap for the styling, and Flutterwave for the payment gateway.



The website is live at  https://kapelar410.github.io/Gracious-Giving/ and the test card is: 

Card-type -  Mastercard

Card-number - 5531886652142950

CVV - 564

PIN - 3310

Expiry - 09/32

OTP - 12345
